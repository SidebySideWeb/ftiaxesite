# Multilingual Setup Summary

## Status: âœ… Infrastructure Ready

Multilingual support (Greek & English) is ready to be implemented using **Payload CMS's built-in localization**.

## What's Done

1. âœ… Removed next-intl library (simpler approach)
2. âœ… Created setup guide: `MULTILINGUAL_SETUP.md`
3. âœ… Build is working cleanly
4. âœ… Committed and pushed to GitHub

## What's Next

### Immediate Steps (Choose One):

**Option A: Enable Now (Recommended)**
- Enable localization in Payload CMS Pages collection
- Add language switcher to Header
- Update API calls to include locale parameter

**Option B: Defer for Later**
- Keep documentation ready
- Implement when needed
- Current site works fine as Greek-only

## Implementation Notes

The new approach uses Payload CMS's native localization instead of a third-party library:

âœ… **Benefits:**
- No extra dependencies
- CMS-managed translations (content creators control all languages)
- SEO-friendly (each language has its own URL)
- Simple implementation
- Scalable (easy to add more languages)

âœ… **How It Works:**
1. CMS stores Greek & English content
2. URL includes `?lang=en` for English
3. Language switcher changes URL parameter
4. Frontend requests content in selected language

## Documentation
